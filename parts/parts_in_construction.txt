simple_trig/SimpleTrigSolve  -- computing solutions to the trig functions is not possible at the moment, since SymPy does not support solving
                                over irrational numbers

probability/PiecewiseProbDensityFunction -- waiting for a 'select plausible values' engine to finish the Conditional class-


WordedDefiniteIntegral - values can be a bit crazy, need to sanity-ise them



what is needed is a prpoer engine for selecting plausible values
e.g. choose a value in a domain such that an integral from the left side to this point gives a simple value


also what is needed is a solutions_working engine, for showing lines of standard solutions working - 
e.g. solving 1/2 * cos(pi * a / 2) = -1/4 -- the answers are a = 4/3, 8/3, but we'd like something that parses the input, and solves it against a value
        storing the lines in a Lines() object as it goes (I think?)



sympy things to work on:

1. 
x = Symbol('x', real=True)
solve(Abs(x - 1) - 1) errors

if x = Symbol('x'), it works fine
