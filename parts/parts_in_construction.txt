sketch/SimpleSketch  -- needs a little more work on the solution for EquationTransformation, it's related to noevals.noevalAdd/Mul/Pow.
                        Basically, you can't show intermediate steps of working because Add/Mul/Pow immediately evaluate, and noevals.noeval 
                        is not working (due to a bug in SymPy)

simple_trig/SimpleTrigSolve  -- computing solutions to the trig functions is not possible at the moment, since SymPy does not support solving
                                over irrational numbers

probability/PiecewiseProbDensityFunction -- find b such that Pr(X <= b) = some_value

WordedDefiniteIntegral - values can be a bit crazy, need to sanity-ise them
