simple_trig/SimpleTrigSolve  -- computing solutions to the trig functions is not possible at the moment, since SymPy does not support solving
                                over irrational numbers

probability/PiecewiseProbDensityFunction -- waiting for a 'select plausible values' engine to finish the Conditional class-


WordedDefiniteIntegral - values can be a bit crazy, need to sanity-ise them



what is needed is a prpoer engine for selecting plausible values
e.g. choose a value in a domain such that an integral from the left side to this point gives a simple value
