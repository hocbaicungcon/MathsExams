simple_trig/SimpleTrigSolve  -- computing solutions to the trig functions is not possible at the moment, since SymPy does not support solving
                                over irrational numbers

probability/PiecewiseProbDensityFunction -- find b such that Pr(X <= b) = some_value

WordedDefiniteIntegral - values can be a bit crazy, need to sanity-ise them
